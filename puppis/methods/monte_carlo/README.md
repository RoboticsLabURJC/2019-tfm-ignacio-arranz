# Monte Carlo methods

The Monte Carlo methods finds approximate solutions through random sampling, that is, it approximate the probability of an outcome by running multiple trails.

With Dynamic Programming we solve the Markov Decision Process (MDP) by using value iteration and policty iteration. Both those methods requires a transition and reward probabilities to find the optimal policy (needs a model of the environment).

The Monte Carlos method doesn't require a model. It require only samples of states, actions and rewards. The Monte Carlo methods are applied only to the episodic tasks.
