## Reading Documentation. State of the Art.

These first weeks we use them to acquire knowledge about everything related to Reinforcement Learning.

The tutors gave me a lot of information to land in this branch of machine learning so I ordered this information to gain knowledge little by little.

The resources used these weeks have been:

1. [edx course on Reinforcement Learning](https://www.edx.org/es/course/reinforcement-learning-explained-3).
2. Reading of two papers:
  - [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf).
  - [Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf).


As this information, without prior knowledge, was very extensive and overwhelming, I found on the [OpenAi page](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) information about the definitions and actors that come into play in each Reinforced Learning algorithm.
