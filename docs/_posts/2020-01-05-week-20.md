## To Do

- [X] Z.
- [X] Learning about Gym-Pyxies.

## Progress

This beginning of the year has brought progress in the progress of the work. Small goals have been achieved that create a foundation with which to begin building the core work, teaching a vehicle to follow a line using Reinforcement Learning.

### 1. Train a network with the Vanessa's dataset

The neural network of Vanessa Fernandez's work has been trained on a dedicated machine resulting in a functional model that has been able to run successfully.

As a point of review for next week is to check the TensorFlow facilities to verify that the GPU is being used during training as it has taken too long in previous training.

### 2. Learning about Gym-Pyxies


Finally all the Player/Stage software has been installed.

Many things have been learned in this process. During the installation of both libraries there were problems with compilation:

- **Player**: Compilation error on Ubuntu 18.04. The following library is missing:

  ```bash
  /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgeos
  ```
  To solve this, install the following library:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libgeos++-dev
  ```

  More information about the error in [this link](https://github.com/playerproject/player/issues/18).

- **Stage**: Compilation error on Ubuntu 18.04. The following library is missing:

  ```bash
  Could NOT find FLTK (missing: FLTK_LIBRARIES)
  ```

  To solve this, install the following depencences:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install fltk1.3-dev
  sudo apt install libxft-dev
  sudo apt install libxinerama-dev
  ```

  More information about the error in [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25752961/how-to-compile-with-fltk-under-ubuntu).




**Error in execution (Player)**. The terminal returns the following error:

```bash
Player v.3.1.1-dev

error   : Failed to load plugin stageplugin.
error   : libtool reports error: file not found
error   : plugin search path: /usr/local/share/stage/worlds:/usr/local/share/stage/worlds:/usr/local/lib/player-3.1/:/usr/local/lib/
error   : failed to load plugin: stageplugin
error   : failed to parse config file /usr/local/share/stage/worlds/simple.cfg driver blocks
```

To solve this, change the environment variable to this one:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

The library is in `/usr/local/lib/` instead of `/usr/local/lib64/`. For more information, visit [this link](https://sourceforge.net/p/playerstage/mailman/message/30007476/).

Once all the issues were solved, the example looks like this.

With this we already have all the tools prepared to be able to go deeper into this software and create our first Deep Reinforcement Learning project. The task for next week is to go deeper into the library.

## Working

Go deeper into the Player/Stage library by running more examples and understanding the relationship between them and communication. 

## Learned

Patience and perseverance. Reading, researching, searching, asking...in the end you get small steps that together give you small objectives that together get you to the final point. This will have to be the mantra of every day until the end of the work as well as applying it to the personal and professional life.
