## DONE

In this last chapter, all the training sessions have been completed and work has been done on writing up the memory of the final master's work. This report is in this same Spanish language repository and is available for reading. We have also been working on the presentation and defence that will be made of the work.

As a final summary, below you can see a video where a training on the NÃ¼rburgring circuit is carried out and evaluated on the Montreal circuit and the Simple Circuit.

You can see in the video how the result of the algorithm works very well and it is a success to set parameters with a single level of perception and a simple set of actions. It is demonstrated that the training is a success when the trained algorithm is able to run in a different circuit than the training one.
