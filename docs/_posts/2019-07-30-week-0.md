Hello, blog reader!.

I'm Nacho Arranz, student of the Master in [Artificial Vision at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](https://mastervisionartificial.es).

I'm preparing for this new adventure where we will face a problem that I haven't studied before. This will be a challenge that will grow progressively.

With the post that are published every week we will be telling you the advances, problems and solutions about the project and I hope it will be nice to read it and follow it.

Nothing would make me prouder than these post and the tutorials that are presented to help someone understand and learn Reinforcement Learning.

The adventure begins!.
