## To Do

- [X] Pong game using DQN algorithm.
- [ ] Train Vanessa's models.
- [X] Take a look at the pilot. Get ideas to implement the based on reinforcement training.

## Progress

### 1. Pong game using DQN algorithm

Temporarily, a solution has been added to the PONG game using Deep Reinforcement Learning but in this case following the guidelines of the Packtl book, which uses PyTorch as a framework.

The results can be seen in the gif. The training has taken approximately two and a half hours with a team with these characteristics:

- intel i7 7th generation 2.8 GHz 8-core processor.
- 16 Gb of RAM.
- Nvidia 1050Ti GPU.
- 256Gb M.2 SSD hard disk.

As a **future work** there is still to solve the same exercise with the TensorFlow framework but **solving the bug** that appeared in the training.

### 2. Train Vanessa's models

This task has not been solved this week.

Before the training, a **restructuring of all the code**, **models** and **dataset** has been carried out to adapt it to an order where **more types of similar autonomous driving** projects fit.

### 3. Take a look at the pilot. Get ideas to implement the based on reinforcement training.

## Working

There is still a lot of work to be done in restructuring the initial code. I keep working on it until I have some minimum stability that allows me to face the problem with 'reinformenet learning'.

## Learned

Landing on other people's code is a difficult job but it forces you to understand how someone else wants their code. Communicating with the other person to reach a common point where the code can grow is an enriching job.
