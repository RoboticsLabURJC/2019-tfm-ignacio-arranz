## To Do

- [X] Installing and running examples using Gym-Gazebo.

## Progress

### Installing and running examples using Gym-Gazebo

Following the installation guide I have been looking at the structure of the project. I had to make an installation guide by cleaning the previous documentation file as it has information about previous versions of Ubuntu.

Focusing on Ubuntu 18.04 I have gathered the installation and [README files into one](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz/blob/master/gym-gazebo/README.md), organizing it in a more progressive way (I am still working on it).

When I've got some clear steps, I've created an installation video of the project (the dependencies are assumed to be installed). You can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJ69h5ANP90&t=0s).

{% include video id="MJ69h5ANP90" provider="youtube" %}


## Working

Currently I am still restructuring the documentation and preparing an installation script to speed up the first steps.

## Learned

Good documentation helps to land and start using the tools faster :-)
