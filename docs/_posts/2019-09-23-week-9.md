This week we are going to install the necessary libraries to have the TensorFlow library installed as well as some examples from [this repository](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-phd-alberto-martin).

# To Do

The tasks proposed for this week are

- [X] Install the Dockerfile [provided here](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-phd-alberto-martin/tree/master/dockers).
- [X] Replicate the infrastructure of the mentioned [repository](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-phd-alberto-martin).
- [ ] Install environment to replicate examples of [Vanessa Fernandez's](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2017-tfm-vanessa-fernandez) end-of-master job.


# Progress

Some of the robotics libraries that will be used during the development of this work are:
- [JdeRobot](jderobot.org) (open toolkit for developing Robotics applications).
- [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org) (simulator).
- [ROS](https://www.ros.org) (Robot Operating System).

With these tools we will have a part of the infrastructure where the learning algorithms will be trained later by "Reinforcement Learning".

## Install Docker images.

To install the docker you need the Dockerfile files from [this repository](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-phd-alberto-martin/tree/master/dockers) with the command:

```bash
docker build -t cuda_cudnn_ros_melodic_python3 .
```

and

```bash
docker build -t ros_melodic_gazebo .
``` 

## Replicate examples from the repository

As a first objective I wanted to launch a test world of Gazebo inside the container as well as the GzWeb client to be able to visualize it in the web browser (outside the container).

To do this:

- Start the container:

  ```bash
  docker run -ti --rm -p 11311:11311 -p 11345:11345 -p 8080:8080 -p 7681:7681 ros_melodic_gazebo bash
  ```

- Run the following instructions inside the container:

  ```bash
  roscore &
  ```
 
- We clone and run a test world of the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-phd-alberto-martin
  cd 2019-phd-alberto-martin/gym-pyxis/gym_pyxis/envs/gazebo/assets/launch
  roslaunch turtlebot3_followline.launch
  ```

- In another terminal (for simplicity) we run the Gazebo (web) client inside the container:

  ```bash
  cd gzweb
  npm start
  ```

The result is that the world can be seen in the browser as in the images:

## Working

- I'm working on replicating the Vanessa Martinez's end-of-master work environment.
- Reading [Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) article](https://medium.com/tensorflow/deep-reinforcement-learning-playing-cartpole-through-asynchronous-advantage-actor-critic-a3c-7eab2eea5296).

## Learned

First approach to the environment where the work will be developed.
