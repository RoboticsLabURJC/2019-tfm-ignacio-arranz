## To Do

- [X] Simple client on Gym-Pyxis.
- [X] Fix GPU in dedicated server.

## Progress

### 1. Simple client on Gym-Pyxis

I have had many problems replicating examples using the Gym-pyxies library and problems with ROS. 

This week has been a key point in the end of master work since we have reached a point of no return with the given library we can't find the sense to use simultaneously the 2D simulator (Player/Stage) and the 3D simulator (Gazebo). This is why we are going to use the second option, only Gazebo. Besides, the use of Gazebo makes the Gym-Pyxies library not make sense at all so we will use the original library: gym-gazebo.

As a point of this week we will try to recreate the same case as the previous week but instead of using Gym-Pyxies, we will use Gym-Gazebo.

We will see if we can get a client to connect to Gazebo by solving all the previous problems.

Stay tuned!

### 2. Fix GPU in dedicated server

The server is currently under maintenance with updated libraries and drivers.

## Working

Creating the client using Gym-Gazebo as an intermediary against Gazebo.

## Learned

Having reached a point of no return, it is worth rethinking the path and taking an alternative one in time to progress more safely. We will try to make this the good one :-)
