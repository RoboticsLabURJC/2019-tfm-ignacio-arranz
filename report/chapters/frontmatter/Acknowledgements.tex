\section*{Abstract}
\textit{This project solves the classic problem of "following the line" in robotics. Using the Gazebo simulator with several circuits containing a central line, with the use of the camera incorporated in the car model, the aim is to solve the circuit using reinforcement learning. The study of different combinations of parameters for this problem using the 'Qlearn' algorithm provides information with which to create a sufficient combination that is capable of solving the set of circuits proposed. This work is part of the solution of the same 'follow the line' problem but using different ways of intelligent training. This completes the main learning methods: classification, regression and learning by reinforcement.}
