\section*{Abstract}
\textit{This Master's Thesis describes the development carried out for the construction of a test environment where a model of a Formula-1, through Reinforcement Learning algorithms is able to solve the exercise of the Follow-the-Lines using computer vision. By means of different tests with different configurations of action and perception parameters, a study will be made of the configuration that best resolves the circuit in terms of lap times compared to a robot that resolves it explicitly. All this infrastructure will be done using free software standards in the world of robotics such as ROS for communications, Gazebo for the three-dimensional representation of the scene and and Python as a programming language.}\\

\textit{\textbf{Keywords}: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, robotics, computer vision, autonomous driving, Python.}
