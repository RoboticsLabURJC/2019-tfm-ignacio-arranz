**`gym-gazebo` is a complex piece of software for roboticists that puts together simulation tools, robot middlewares (ROS, ROS 2), machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques. All together to create an environment whereto benchmark and develop behaviors with robots. Setting up `gym-gazebo` appropriately requires relevant familiarity with these tools.**

**Code is available "as it is" and currently it's not supported by any specific organization. Community support is available [here](https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo/issues). Pull requests and contributions are welcomed.**

## Community-maintained environments
The following are some of the gazebo environments maintained by the community using `gym-gazebo`. If you'd like to contribute and maintain an additional environment, submit a Pull Request with the corresponding addition.

| Name | Middleware | Description | Observation Space | Action Space | Reward range |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ----- | --------- | -------- |
| ![GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0](imgs/GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0.png)`GazeboCircuit2TurtlebotLidar-v0` | ROS | A simple circuit with straight tracks and 90 degree turns. Highly discretized LIDAR readings are used to train the Turtlebot. Scripts implementing **Q-learning** and **Sarsa** can be found in the _examples_ folder. | | | |

## Other environments (no support provided for these environments)

The following table compiles a number of other environments that **do not have
community support**.

The goal of this environment is defined to reach the center of the "O" from the "H-ROS" logo within the workspace. This environment compared to `GazeboModularScara3DOF-v2` is not pausing the Gazebo simulation and is tested in algorithms that solve continuous action space (PPO1 and ACKTR from baselines).This environment uses `slowness=1` and matches the delay between actions/observations to this value (slowness). In other words, actions are taken at "1/slowness" rate.| Box(10,) | Box(3,) | (-1, 1) [`if rmse<5 mm 1 - rmse else reward=-rmse`]|

## Installation
Refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Usage

### Build and install gym-gazebo

In the root directory of the repository:

```bash
sudo pip install -e .
```

### Running an environment

- Load the environment variables corresponding to the robot you want to launch. E.g. to load the Turtlebot:

```bash
cd gym_gazebo/envs/installation
bash turtlebot_setup.bash
```

Note: all the setup scripts are available in `gym_gazebo/envs/installation`

- Run any of the examples available in `examples/`. E.g.:

```bash
cd examples/turtlebot
python circuit2_turtlebot_lidar_qlearn.py
```

### Display the simulation

To see what's going on in Gazebo during a simulation, run gazebo client. In order to launch the `gzclient` and be able to connect it to the running `gzserver`:
1. Open a new terminal.
2. Source the corresponding setup script, which will update the _GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH_ variable: e.g. `source setup_turtlebot.bash`
3. Export the _GAZEBO_MASTER_URI_, provided by the [gazebo_env](https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo/blob/7c63c16532f0d8b9acf73663ba7a53f248021453/gym_gazebo/envs/gazebo_env.py#L33). You will see that variable printed at the beginning of every script execution. e.g. `export GAZEBO_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:13853`

**Note**: This instructions are needed now since `gazebo_env` creates a random port for the GAZEBO_MASTER_URI, which allows to run multiple instances of the simulation at the same time. You can remove the following two lines from the environment if you are not planning to launch multiple instances:

```bash
os.environ["ROS_MASTER_URI"] = "http://localhost:"+self.port
os.environ["GAZEBO_MASTER_URI"] = "http://localhost:"+self.port_gazebo
```

Finally, launch gzclient.
```bash
gzclient

```

### Display reward plot

Display a graph showing the current reward history by running the following script:

```bash
cd examples/utilities
python display_plot.py
```

HINT: use `--help` flag for more options.

### Killing background processes

Sometimes, after ending or killing the simulation `gzserver` and `rosmaster` stay on the background, make sure you end them before starting new tests.

We recommend creating an alias to kill those processes.

```bash
echo "alias killgazebogym='killall -9 rosout roslaunch rosmaster gzserver nodelet robot_state_publisher gzclient'" >> ~/.bashrc
```
